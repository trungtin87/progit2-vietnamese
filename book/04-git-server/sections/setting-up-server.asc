=== Setting Up the Server

Let's walk through setting up SSH access on the server side.
In this example, you'll use the `authorized_keys` method for authenticating your users.
We also assume you're running a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.

[NOTE]
====
A good deal of what is described here can be automated by using the `ssh-copy-id` command, rather than manually copying and installing public keys.
====

First, you create a `git` user account and a `.ssh` directory for that user.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo adduser git
$ su git
$ cd
$ mkdir .ssh && chmod 700 .ssh
$ touch .ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
----

Next, you need to add some developer SSH public keys to the `authorized_keys` file for the `git` user.
Let's assume you have some trusted public keys and have saved them to temporary files.
Again, the public keys look something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L
ojG6rs6hPB09j9R/T17/x4lhJA0F3FR1rP6kYBRsWj2aThGw6HXLm9/5zytK6Ztg3RPKK+4k

dAv8JggJICUvax2T9va5 gsg-keypair
----

You just append them to the `git` user's `authorized_keys` file in its `.ssh` directory:

[source,console]
----
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.josie.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.jessica.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
----

Now, you can set up an empty repository for them by running `git init` with the `--bare` option, which initializes the repository without a working directory:(((git commands, init, bare)))

[source,console]
----
$ cd /srv/git
$ mkdir project.git
$ cd project.git
$ git init --bare

no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEwENNMomTboYI+LJieaAY16qiXiH3wuvENhBG...
----

Now Git network commands will still work just fine but the users won't be able to get a shell.
As the output states, you can also set up a directory in the `git` user's home directory that customizes the `git-shell` command a bit.
For instance, you can restrict the Git commands that the server will accept or you can customize the message that users see if they try to SSH in like that.
Run `git help shell` for more information on customizing the shell.(((git commands, help)))
