==== Small Setups

If you're a small outfit or are just trying out Git in your organization and have only a few developers, things can be simple for you.
One of the most complicated aspects of setting up a Git server is user management.
If you want some repositories to be read-only for certain users and read/write for others, access and permissions can be a bit more difficult to arrange.

===== SSH Access

(((serving repositories, SSH)))
If you have a server to which all your developers already have SSH access, it's generally easiest to set up your first repository there, because you have to do almost no work (as we covered in the last section).
If you want more complex access control type permissions on your repositories, you can handle them with the normal filesystem permissions of your server's operating system.

If you want to place your repositories on a server that doesn't have accounts for everyone on your team for whom you want to grant write access, then you must set up SSH access for them.
We assume that if you have a server with which to do this, you already have an SSH server installed, and that's how you're accessing the server.

There are a few ways you can give access to everyone on your team.
The first is to set up accounts for everybody, which is straightforward but can be cumbersome.
You may not want to run `adduser` (or the possible alternative `useradd`) and have to set temporary passwords for every new user.

A second method is to create a single 'git' user account on the machine, ask every user who is to have write access to send you an SSH public key, and add that key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of that new 'git' account.
At that point, everyone will be able to access that machine via the 'git' account.
This doesn't affect the commit data in any way -- the SSH user you connect as doesn't affect the commits you've recorded.

Another way to do it is to have your SSH server authenticate from an LDAP server or some other centralized authentication source that you may already have set up.
As long as each user can get shell access on the machine, any SSH authentication mechanism you can think of should work.
