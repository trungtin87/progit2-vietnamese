This scenario often includes a canonical repository that represents the "`official`" project.
To contribute to that project, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to it.
Then, you can send a request to the maintainer of the main project to pull in your changes.
The maintainer can then add your repository as a remote, test your changes locally, merge them into their branch, and push back to their repository.
The process works as follows (see <<wfdiag_b>>):

1.  The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.
2.  A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.
3.  The contributor pushes to their own public copy.
4.  The contributor sends the maintainer an email asking them to pull changes.
5.  The maintainer adds the contributor's repository as a remote and merges locally.
6.  The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.

(((forking)))
This is a very common workflow with hub-based tools like GitHub or GitLab, where it's easy to fork a project and push your changes into your fork for everyone to see.
One of the main advantages of this approach is that you can continue to work, and the maintainer of the main repository can pull in your changes at any time.
Contributors don't have to wait for the project to incorporate their changes -- each party can work at their own pace.

==== Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow

(((workflows, dictator and lieutenants)))
This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow.
It's generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the Linux kernel.
Various integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they're called _lieutenants_.
All the lieutenants have one integration manager known as the benevolent dictator.
The benevolent dictator pushes from their directory to a reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull.
The process works like this (see <<wfdiag_c>>):

1.  Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of `master`.
    The `master` branch is that of the reference repository to which the dictator pushes.
2.  Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their `master` branch.
3.  The dictator merges the lieutenants' `master` branches into the dictator's `master` branch.
4.  Finally, the dictator pushes that `master` branch to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.

This kind of workflow isn't common, but can be useful in very big projects, or in highly hierarchical environments.
It allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.

==== Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches

[NOTE]

Martin Fowler has made a guide "Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches".
This guide covers all the common Git workflows, and explains how/when to use them.
There's also a section comparing high and low integration frequencies.

==== Workflows Summary

These are some commonly used workflows that are possible with a distributed system like Git, but you can see that many variations are possible to suit your particular real-world workflow.
Now that you can (hopefully) determine which workflow combination may work for you, we'll cover some more specific examples of how to accomplish the main roles that make up the different flows.
In the next section, you'll learn about a few common patterns for contributing to a project.
